## General Info

Small set of 3d printed hardware items that allow the quick and unobtrusive installation of a bungee cord used to secure the lid of a trash can. Works great to prevent winds from throwing trash everywhere or keep nocturnal pests from going through your trash.

The bungee cord also makes a great handle for opening and closing the lid without touching the dirty inner handle area.

## Technologies

- Fusion 360

## Setup

Drill two 1/4 inch holes, one in the lid of the trash can and one just below it in the main body. Both holes should be about 6 inches from the opening of the trash can and centered on the body.

Attach the cleat hardware item to the lower hole using a 1/4-20 thread and locking nut with washer on the backside (nut should be inside of trash can).

Feed a piece of bungee cord through the button hardware item so both loose ends are exiting towards the rounded side of the button. Tie an overhand knot to secure them. Feed the loop end of the bungee through the hole in the lid and check that it reaches the cleat with enough tension to hold the lid closed.

## Usage

Simply hook the bungee over the cleat when you put the trashcan outside.

## Notes

Occasionally the trash pickup workers will drop the can or otherwise break the cleat hardware, it is a good idea to print a few extra just in case you need them.
